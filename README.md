stepostr- a Step by Step Topic Documentation Content Resource Management (CRM) Web Platform.

Problem: Currently, we have dozens of Content Resource Management (CRM) web platforms for documenting topics about almost anything. We use them for blogs, technical documentation, wikis, and more. But if somebody wants to setup a website that only deals with step by step guide on certain topics, they will find out that most of the available CRMs will involve lots of customizations that require technical knowledge. This also means that these CRMs require a steep learning curve.

Vision: To provide a Content Resource Management web platform specifically designed for easily documenting topics which are represented in step by step fashion.

Benefits: stepostr will be useful for documenting topics, how-to articles, step by step guides, and similar pages for:
•	Personal blogs
•	Hobby blogs
•	Technical documentations 
•	Procedural documentations
•	etc.n
Users will be able to easily compose, publish, and maintain posts due to the application being tailored for step by step topic documentation.
